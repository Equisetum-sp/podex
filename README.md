# Podéx
is a great application developed by Pokémon Group in realisation for a modern - solution informative Pokédex , specially 1st Generation Pokémon Game, which includes :

Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue (1996), followed by the special edition Pokémon Yellow (1999)

The Game was developed by The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, and Game Freak to unleash the excitement of collecting cutest creatures called Pokémon.

We see that many players are using emulators on their phone, and couldn't help of looking up online tricks and tips for the game. opening the browser and searching for it was a pain when you didn't have a internet (since all emulators are using internal stored file to load game file, there's no need internet connection).

And to be able to open and search at browser, you need internet. it's annoying that you need to turn off and on the internet frequently to switch from emulators to browsers and vice versa.

Not to mention, many FREE emulators did gave us some little sauce called "Ads" which annoying when you've read the tips at internet, and trying to go back to the emulator app, "Pengiriman Cepat Gratis Ongkir" Just Popped Up. and then, after the ads are finished , you forgotten of what the trick says and forced to repeat steps.

But, What if we made a Pokédex app that goes offline but offers tons of informations just as good as website shows and available offline?

Well, Podéx got you :) it's the app for you :)
